** DONE Plan a workflow model
* Workflow Model
** Highlight/ Annotation Creation
- open page
- select text, a tooltip menu pops up
- click on highlight or annotate
- annotation textbox opens
- write comments with org-mode syntax
- choose node to append to with a tree like filtering (should use ripgrep for quickly finding all subtree headers)
- annotation with metadata gets appended to the specified node
** Storage

*** org-files

- when a user opens a page, they might want to take notes on
  - a new file -> create a new file
  - an existing node with no previous roamex notes -> create a roamex subtree under that node
  - an existing node with previous roamex notes
    - for the same url -> create a new subtree for the new note
    - for a new url -> create a new URL subtree
*** extension
**** when a user opens a URL, the extension needs to retrieve all the highlights and annotations of the current page
- lets store all of that in IndexedDB
  - how to keep it synced?
***** a page might have annotations in different files
****** Maintain a database of URL to nodes mapping?
if the annotation is editable and is synced two ways, how to ensure that?
* FIXME
** Encode URLs before storing, otherwise FastAPI can mistake queries
- for example, retrieving notes do not work on http://127.0.0.1:13579/notes?url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28262122
